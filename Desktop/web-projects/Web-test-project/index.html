   <h1> My evil best friend Keratoconus</h1>   
   <h2> When you find out you have a Keratoconus, at first you think to yourself. 'Well I really hope that some glasses can help me', but then realize that it isn't that simple. It's actually life changing because ophthalmologists and optometrists start to throw out words like corneal transplant, cross-linking and scary sounding stuff like that, then you know that it is serious. I found out actually a couple of months before becoming a UPS driver. The doctors that were working with me really tried their best to help me out.

	   In March 2017 on both eyes I got cross-linking done to try to slow down the keratoconus, and an Intac in my left eye that same day. It definitely did not improve my vision, but I did notice that my vision wasn't getting worse. I went from perfect vision all my life, never needing glasses to " Holy crap something is wrong" in a matter of months. I started to realize something was wrong when I would drive at night and see 5 tailights.... but I knew there was only 1 car in front of me. By the time I  acctually got my cross-linking done to strengeth my cornea it was already too late. My vision was pretty bad already at night. The scleral contacts did improve my night driving ALOT but still not to the point where I once was.
   </h2>
 <h3> Instead of rambling on about everything here is a quick list of how I feel keratoconus has effected me directly.
  <ul>
    <li> Driving at night</li>
    <li> Going to a movie theatres</li>
    <li> Trying to find something on the floor</li>
    <li> Very foggy and blurring vision when waking up</li>
    <li> Can't watch a screen or t.v when it is dark in the room</li>
    <li> Losing my very good driving job as a UPS driver</li>
   <h/3>
